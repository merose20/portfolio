<b>LESSON 1:

The Internet and the Word Wide Web

The Internet</b> 
One of the major reasons business, home, and other users purchase computers is for Internet access.
The Internet is a widely used research tool, providing society with access to global information
and instant communications. Further, access to the Internet can occur anytime from a computer
anywhere: at home, at work, at school, in a restaurant, on an airplane, and at a park.

The Internet, also called the Net, is a worldwide collection of networks that links millions of
businesses, government agencies, educational institutions, and individuals. Each of the networks
on the Internet provides resources that add to the abundance of goods, services, and information
accessible via the Internet.

Today, more than one billion home and business users around the world
access a variety of services on the Internet. The World Wide Web, or simply the Web, and e-mail
are two of the more widely used Internet services. Other services include chat rooms, instant
messaging, and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol).

<b>CHAPTER 2

Introduction to HTML

Introduction

HTML</b> stands for <b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b>. It is used to design web pages using markup language.
HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the
web pages. Markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the
structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so
that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most of markup (e.g. HTML)
languages are human readable. Language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on thetext.

HTML is a markup language which is used by the browser to manipulate text, images and other
content to display it in required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first
ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0 but the first standard version was HTML 2.0 which was published
in 1999.

<b>CHAPTER 3

HTML - TEXT & TEXT FORMATTING

HTML - TEXT </b>
Text is the backbone of any web page. It plays an double role; it provides content for web surfers
to enjoy as they skim through articles and articles of information, but it also gives Search
Engines and Spiders keywords and meta data. It is because of text on web pages that we have a
network of seemingly endless information available at our fingers.

<b>HTML - Paragraph Text</b>
Any text containing more than a few lines (or sometimes even more) should exist inside of a
paragraph tag <p>. This tag is reserved specifically for blocks of text, such as those you would
expect to find inside your favorite novel.
