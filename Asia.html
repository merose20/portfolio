    <p>
      Wat Arun is the missile-shaped temple that rises from the Chao Phraya River's banks. Known as
Temple of Dawn, it was named after the Indian god of dawn, Arun. It was here that, after the 
destruction of Ayuthaya, King Taksin stumbled upon a small local shrine and interpreted the discovery
 as an auspicious sign that this should be the site of the new capital of Siam. Located on the west 
bank of the Chao Phraya River, Wat Arun is famous for its magnificent 79-meter-high central spire, 
reputed as being Thailand's Eiffel Tower, which has a unique design and fine craftsmanship. It is the 
best place to overlook the Chao Phraya River and enjoy the night view. Given the beauty of the 
architecture and the fine craftsmanship, it’s not surprising that Wat Arun is considered by many as 
one of the most beautiful temples in Thailand.
