    <p><strong><font color="#24BAEC">COLOSSEUM,ROME</font></strong></p>
    <p>This huge amphitheater, the largest of its kind ever built by the Roman Empire and the largest 
of their constructions to survive, remained a model for sports facilities right up to modern times. 
Built by Vespasian in 72 CE and enlarged by the addition of a fourth story by his son, Titus, the 
Colosseum was a venue for public spectacles and shows - even mock sea battles. A wooden floor that 
was 83 by 48 meters covered two additional underground stories with tunnels, rooms, cells, and 
passages that provided space for gladiators, workers, wild animals, and storage.Today, the structure 
stands in stark contrast to the modern development that surrounds it and is a prominent reminder of 
ancient times and the extensive history of Rome.</p>

    <p><strong><font color="#24BAEC">AMALFI COAST</font></strong></p>
    <p>The Amalfi Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a stunning stretch of coastline along the 
Sorrentine Peninsula, south of Naples and Sorrento. Hillside towns are built precariously along the 
steep mountainsides that cascade down to the sea.The main towns along here are Positano and Amalfi, 
with its colorfully domed cathedral. You can tour the coast by road, or hop between towns by boat for
 different perspectives of the dramatic and almost vertical shore.While walking paths stretch all 
along the coast, the most breathtaking scenery for walkers is the Sentiero degli Dei, Footpath of the 
Gods, at the western end from Positano. My favorite viewpoint is far above the Amalfi Drive, in the 
village of Ravello. Clinging to the steep mountainside in terraces, Ravello was a sizable town in the 
13th century and the gardens of its former villas make scenic belvederes for enjoying flower-framed 
views of the coast below.

    <p><strong><font color="#24BAEC">MILAN DUOMO</font></strong></p>
    <p>
      Milan's magnificent Cathedral of Santa Maria Nascente, "Il Duomo" to the locals, is one of the 
world's largest churches and probably the best example anywhere of the flamboyant Gothic style. Its 
statue-studded façade (the exterior of the cathedral has a grand total of 2,245 marble statues) and 
the 135 carved stone pinnacles that crown its roof make quite a first impression, which is reinforced 
as you step inside. Fifty-two immense pillars support the soaring ceiling of the nave, and its walls 
are decorated by the world's largest stained-glass windows. Highlights in the nave are the tomb of
 Gian Giacomo Medici and a 12th-century bronze candelabrum. Below the high altar is the crypt and the 
octagonal chapel with the gold reliquary of San Carlo Borromeo. Under Piazza del Duomo, and reached 
by stairs near the entrance, are the foundations of a fourth-century baptistery and basilica. 
An elevator will take you partway to the roof, where you can walk at a dizzying height among the 
carved stone pinnacles.

    <p>
     You'll never forget the first time you see Switzerland's most symbolic mountain, the Matterhorn. 
Maybe you arrive in the charming village of Zermatt, at its base, on a clear blue day and the 
4,478-meter high, tooth-shaped mountain looms clearly in front of you. Or maybe it is spitting 
rain when you first set foot in the car-free town, and it isn't until the next morning that you 
witness the emblematic peak emerging from a sea of dissipating clouds. Whichever way you first see 
this legendary mountain, it will remain seared into your memory for years to come. It's that 
impressive.

    <p>
      Spanning 150 meters, the Rhine Falls (Rheinfall) at Schaffhausen are the largest falls in Europe.
 The best time to visit is during June and July when the mountain snow melts, and the falls swell in 
volume to spill over a 21-meter-high ledge of Jurassic limestone. Boat trips up the Rhine provide 
excellent views of the falls, as do the viewing platforms on both sides of the river.

     Imagine a sparkling blue lake surrounded by mountains, a car-free medieval old town, 
covered bridges, waterfront promenades, frescoed historic buildings, and sun-splashed plazas with 
bubbling fountains. No wonder Lucerne (in German, Luzern) is a top spot for tourists. Famed for its 
music concerts, this quintessential Swiss town lures renowned soloists, conductors, and orchestras to 
its annual International Music Festival. The Culture and Convention Center is home to one of the
 world's leading concert halls.

    <p>
      The Eiffel Tower is a feat of ingenuity as much as it is a famous landmark. This structure of 
8,000 metallic parts was designed by Gustave Eiffel as a temporary exhibit for the World Fair of 
1889. Originally loathed by critics, the 330-meter-high tower is now a beloved and irreplaceable 
fixture of the Paris skyline. Upon the first glimpse, you'll be impressed by the tower's delicate 
airiness despite its monumental size. Next, the panoramas at each of the three levels will take your
breath away.

      Escape into a bucolic landscape of olive groves, sun-drenched rolling hills, and deep purple 
lavender fields, with little villages nestled in the valleys and perched on rocky outcrops. 
The vibrant scenery has enchanted many famous artists, including Cézanne, Matisse, Chagall, and 
Picasso. The rustic natural beauty, country charm, and laid-back atmosphere of Provence allow the 
region's art de vivre (art of living) to flourish. Sultry weather encourages leisurely strolls along 
cobblestone streets and afternoons spent on sunny terraces of outdoor cafés.

    <p>
     Traveling through the Loire Valley gives the impression of stepping into a children's storybook. 
Turreted fairy-tale castles grace a luxuriant countryside of dense woodlands and gently flowing 
rivers. The entire Loire Valley, an area known as the "Garden of France," is listed as a UNESCO World
 Heritage Site. Some of the Loire castles are medieval fortresses built on hilltops and surrounded 
by ramparts. However, the most famous Loire châteaux are sumptuous Renaissance palaces that were 
designed purely for enjoyment and entertainment, as an extension of court life outside of Paris.
