    <p>
      Though she may have been born in France, the Statue of Liberty has become synonymous with 
America and the countryâ€™s highest-held values. True, the 151-foot-tall copper monument can be seen 
up close from aboard the free Staten Island Ferry, but you can also pay your respects in person and
 even step inside it while on an official tour.

    <p>
      Situated on the border of New York and Canada, the three waterfalls (Horseshoe Falls, American
 Falls and Bridalveil Falls) have the combined highest flow rate of any waterfall worldwide. 
Their impressive force is nothing short of awe-worthy. A top tourist destination since the 19th 
century, the unstoppable beauty and charm of Niagara Falls make it a memorable and unique landmark.

    <p>
      The Grand Canyon in Arizona is a natural formation distinguished by layered bands of red rock, 
revealing millions of years of geological history in cross-section. Vast in scale, the canyon 
averages 10 miles across and a mile deep along its 277-mile length. Much of the area is a national 
park, with Colorado River white-water rapids and sweeping vistas.

    <p><strong><font color="#75B459">EL MORRO FORT</font></strong></p>
    <p>
      El Morro was initially fortified in 1539 and completed in 1589. Rising 140 feet above the sea, 
its 18-foot-thick wall proved a formidable defense. It fell only once, in 1538, to a land assault by 
the Earl of Cumberland's forces. The fort is a maze of tunnels, dungeons, barracks, outposts and ramps.
 Many restorations and expansions contributed to the imposing structure it is today. The area was 
designated a National Historic Site in February 1949 with 74 total acres.

    <p><strong><font color="#75B459">CAMUY CAVES</font></strong></p>
    <p>
      This incredible 268-acre park is the site of the great subterranean caverns carved out by the 
Camuy River over one million years ago. The park is one of the largest underground formations in the 
Western Hemisphere, and only seven miles (11km) of this series of limestone caves have been fully 
explored. The impeccably maintained trails gently descend 200 feet through a fern filled ravine to 
the yawning, cathedral-like caverns. The park is one of the world's largest cave networks. Sixteen 
entranced have been found and 11 kilometers (7 miles) of passages explored so far. Tours available, 
visitors are guided through one cave and two sinkholes, there are fine examples of stalactites, 
stalagmites and, of course, plenty of bats. The park is equipped with picnic areas, walking trails, 
food facilities, and exhibition hall and a souvenir shop, making it the perfect place to spend a day.

    <p><strong><font color="#75B459">OLD SAN JUAN</font></strong></p>
    <p>
      This is a 465-year-old neighborhood originally conceived as a military stronghold. Its 
7-square-block area has evolved into a charming residential and commercial district. The streets 
here are paved with cobbles of adoquine, a blue stone cast from furnace slag; they were brought over 
a ballast on Spanish ships and time and moisture have lent them their characteristic color. The city
 includes more than 400 carefully restored 16th- and 17th-century Spanish colonial buildings. 
The Old San Juan attracts many tourists, who also enjoy the gambling casinos, fine beaches, and 
tropical climate.

    <p><strong><font color="#75B459">ANGEL FALLS</font></strong></p>
    <p>
      The heart of the country, where table top mountains rise up like giant monoliths from the 
surrounding landscape, is Angel Falls. Dropping 979 meters, it is the highest waterfall in the world
 and one of the highlights of South America. This stunning site in Canaima National Park is remote 
and difficult to access, but flights over the falls are easily arranged.

    <p>
      The table-top mountain of Roraima has an alluring appeal for nature lovers and adventure seekers,
 with an almost mystical Jack and the Beanstalk type of wonder attached to it. Rising up from the 
surrounding lowlands, Roraima is an island in the sky that has been intriguing people for centuries, 
with its bizarre rock formations, waterfalls, and meat-eating plants. This tepui (table-top mountain) 
was even the inspiration for Arthur Conan Doyle's famous novel The Lost World.

    <p>
      The archipelago is Los Roques National Park, but most people refer to the area simply as Los 
Roques. This is one of the best places to visit in Venezuela. The small seaside fishing village of 
Gran Roque, on the island of the same name, is the main settlement, with single-story homes painted 
in the typical bright colors seen throughout Venezuela.
